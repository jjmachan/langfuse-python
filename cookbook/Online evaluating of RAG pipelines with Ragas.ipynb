    "# Online Evaluation of RAG pipelines with Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse offers the feature to score your traces and spans. They can be used in multiple ways across Langfuse:\n",
    "1. Displayed on trace to provide a quick overview\n",
    "2. Segment all execution traces by scores to e.g. find all traces with a low-quality score\n",
    "3. Analytics: Detailed score reporting with drill downs into use cases and user segments\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragas is an open-source tool that can help you run [Model-Based Evaluation](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals) on your traces/spans, especially for RAG pipelines. Ragas can perform reference-free evaluations of various aspects of your RAG pipeline. Because it is reference-free you don't need ground-truths when running the evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we are going to use a dataset that has already been prepared by querying a RAG system and gathering its outputs. The dataset contains the following columns\n",
    "- `question`: list[str] - These are the questions your RAG pipeline will be evaluated on.\n",
    "- `answer`: list[str] - The answer generated from the RAG pipeline and given to the user.\n",
    "- `contexts`: list[list[str]] - The contexts which were passed into the LLM to answer the question.\n",
    "- `ground_truths`: list[list[str]] - The ground truth answer to the questions. However, this can be ignored for online evaluations since we will not have access to ground-truth data in our case."
